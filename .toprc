#
# %us individual processor utilization (userland processes); % of avail cores.
#
# %sy system CPU usage; higher numbers may indicate a problem with kernel
# configs, a driver issue, etc.
#
# %ni percentage of CPU by userland processes that have been niced. Does not
# overlap with %us which only shows processes using the default priority.
#
# %id this is the result of subtracting the previous 3 numbers from 100.0%, and
# measures idle processing power.
#
# %wa iowait percentage. A measure of disk performance. When a process requests
# data it first checks processor caches, then checks memory, and finally disk.
# The IO thread waits until the data is read into RAM. Slower disk means higher
# iowait. Also when system buffers are full and need to be flushed by the kernel
# -- e.g.: on high-load database servers. iowait consistently over {100 / (number
# of CPUs * number of processes)}% could mean a storage issue. If you see a high
# load average check THIS number FIRST. If high then processes are bottlenecking
# on available disk. Need faster disk or to distribute usage across other
# hypervisors or disks.
#
# %hi hard interrupt. On a circuit board the electrons move through chips in
# a predictable manner. E.g: when a network card receives a packet, before
# transferring the information in the packet to the processor via the kernel, it
# will ask for an interrupt on an interrupt line on the motherboard. The
# processor reports to the kernel that the network card has information for it
# and the kernel can decide what to do. A high %hi stat is rare on a virtual
# machine. High network throughput, USB usage, GPU computations may contribute to
# %hi.
#
# %si soft interrupt. Virtualized interrupts (kernel 2.4+). E.g., a tcpdump on
# a 1 gig link with high traffic can bring this to about 10%, as tcpdump's
# allocated memory fills, it requests an interrupt to move the data off its stack
# and onto the disk, screen, etc.
#
# %st iosteal. A measure of how busy the hypervisor is. Virtual CPUs in VMs will
# schedule work across all physical CPUs in a hopefully balanced/scheduled way.
# If more than the number of physical CPUs are being used by VMs virtual CPUs
# iosteal will go up. Consistently high iosteal% (over 15%) may imply the
# hypervisor is overloaded and some VMs should be moved.
